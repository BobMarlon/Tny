# Tny: A simple data serializer in C

Tny is a simple library to serialize data in C. It can be seen as
a kind of binary JSON but unlike BSON it also supports arrays as root elements.

It was designed to be simple and easy to use. If you want to know how to use it, take a look
at src/tny/tny.h or the tests located at src/tests.c

## System Requirements

Tny should run on every plattform with a compatible C99 compiler.
No additional libraries are required.
